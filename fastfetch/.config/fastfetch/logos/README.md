# Fastfetch Logo Images

Place your distro logo image here (PNG, JPEG, or other supported formats).

## Recommended Image

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background works best
- **Size**: Any size (fastfetch will scale it)
- **Name**: `distro.png` (or update the config to use a different name)

## Getting a Logo

You can download your distro's logo from:
- Official distro websites
- Icon repositories (like flathub, etc.)
- Or create your own cyberpunk-themed logo!

## Example

If you're using Arch Linux, you can download the Arch logo and save it as `distro.png` in this directory.
